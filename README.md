# Kurt-Gödel

Author: Tyler W Gomes

*Kurt Gödel*

* Found an inconsistency in the constitution that he believed would allow the United States to become a facist dictatorship. Goödel was eventually persuaded by Albert Einstein to not bring it up during his citizenship exam.

* Gödel was incredibly paranoid about being poisoned and he would only eat food his wife had prepared for him. When she became ill and was unable to cook Kurts meals, he refused to eat anything eventually starving himself to death.

* While proving his incompleteness theorems Gödel developed his own set of numbers known as "Gödel numbers". This system allows us to use natural numbers as a representation of a mathematical equation.
